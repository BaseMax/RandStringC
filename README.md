## Check

**`randString1()`**

**`randString2()`**

When your program multi time runs.
You will notice that the production of the random value will be the same.
because that ways depends on memory.

**`randString3()`**

The printed output does not have a direct rely on memory and time.
So you can try it out.

**`randString4()`**

There are also some methods that depend on time.

So if they multi time run in a one seconds...
Will produce the same numbers.



## Ways

The C Programming Language has two function **rand()**, **srand()** then used for randomization.

- time
- /dev/random, /dev/urandom
- ...
